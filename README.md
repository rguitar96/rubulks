<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I built this project as a fun challenge to come up with a data structure representation for the Rubik's Cube. The library allows you to generate cubes, move them around, and natively print its representation as an output. Some TODO stuff include implementing different solvings, adding more predefined algorithms, and more.

As a curiosity, when I asked DALL-E to generate an AI logo for the project, the name RUBULKS appeared after it, so I decided to keep it :)

Below, a simple cube instantiation is shown.
